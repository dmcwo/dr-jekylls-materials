> Into this wilde Abyss,
> The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,
> Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,
> But all these in their pregnant causes mixt
> Confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight,
> Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain
> His dark materials to create more Worlds,
> Into this wilde Abyss the warie fiend
> Stood on the brink of Hell and look'd a while,
> Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith
> He had to cross.

— Paradise Lost, Book 2, lines 910–920
